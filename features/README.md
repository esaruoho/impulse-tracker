# Impulse Tracker (esaruoho fork) — Feature Reference

> **Generated** from the Gherkin report cards in this folder by `python3 features/print-card.py --readme`. Do not hand-edit — edit the `.feature` card and regenerate. Each entry below = one card: *what it does* (the feature intent + behaviour scenarios) and *how it does it* (the procs/files the behaviour is cited to).

Each card is a triad: the `.feature` spec, a `.session.md` (the conversation that produced it), and a RESULT-LOG of what shipped. See `GHERKIN-FEATURE-WIKI-PATTERN.md` and `INDEX.md`.

## Alt-R replicate at cursor

`features/alt-r-replicate.feature` · [session](alt-r-replicate.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone filling a pattern channel with a repeating figure, I want Alt-R to tile the rows above the cursor down to the end of the channel, So that I can lay down a one- or few-row loop and stamp it across the pattern without copy/paste — while Shift-Alt-R does the same across the WHOLE pattern (all channels).

**Behaviour (6 scenarios):**

- Alt-R and Shift-Alt-R are disambiguated by live shift state — `@shipped @build-verified @hw-verified`
- Cursor above row 0 tiles the rows-above-cursor chunk downward — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified @hw-verified`
- Cursor on row 0 tiles row 0 down the whole channel — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified @hw-verified`
- No-op at the pattern edges — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Shift-Alt-R replicates the whole PATTERN at cursor — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Both replicate ops are undoable and show a correct label in the undo list — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `PEFunction_AltR_Dispatch`, `PEFunction_ReplicateAtCursor`, `PEFunction_ReplicatePatternAtCursor`, `PEFunction_ClearViews` · **Source files:** `IT_PE.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×6 · @hw-verified ×3 · @runtime-untested ×2 · @runtime-verified ×2 · @shipped ×6

**Commits:** `d506486` Alt-R = Replicate at Cursor · `aaada5e` Alt-R tile at row 0 + Shift-Alt-R = ClearViews (original Alt-R) · `3a3b7ff` Alt-R / Shift-Alt-R get their own undo labels (UndoBufferType23/24)

## Convey test-runner conveys the test situation to a User and routes the verdict back

`features/convey-test-runner.feature` · [session](convey-test-runner.session.md)

**What it does:** As the human who flashes a build to real DOS hardware, I want a runner that shows me each unverified behaviour, takes my works/failed call (with a note when it fails), and folds that straight back into the cards, So that confirming what works costs no chat tokens and the generated status matrices advance themselves — the human run becomes Convey truth.

**Behaviour (6 scenarios):**

- It displays each unverified fork scenario's Given/When/Then to the tester — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- It captures the User's verdict: works / failed (+ how) / skip / back / quit — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- A "works" verdict flips that scenario to @hw-verified in its card — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Failures are conveyed out as the single focused worklist — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- The launcher runs from any directory — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- The runner is excluded from the hardware test matrix — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `(host-side`, `python;`, `no`, `ASM`, `symbols)`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×6 · @runtime-verified ×5 · @shipped ×6

**Commits:** `9ec40af` hwtest.py interactive hardware-test TUI · `e63518b` repo-anchored ./test-impulse-tracker launcher


<a id="f11-order-list"></a>
## User Presses F11 (Order List)

`features/f11-order-list.feature`

**What it does:** As someone sequencing patterns into a song, I want F11 to open the order list and toggle to channel volume, and the fork power tools to clone / extend / render patterns right from the order list, So that arranging and bouncing patterns happens without leaving this screen.

**Behaviour (9 scenarios):**

- F11 opens the order list with channel panning — `@stock @build-verified`
- A second F11 toggles to channel volume — `@stock @build-verified`
- Stock order-list editing keys — `@stock @build-verified`
- Alt-D clones the current pattern to the first free slot — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Alt-E doubles the current pattern's length by tiling — `@shipped @build-verified`
- M toggles the clone mute-wipe mode — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Ctrl-O renders the active pattern to WAV (Shift-Ctrl-O = no import) — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Ctrl-G and Shift-G render variants — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Cursor-key edge gestures clone (left) and render (right) — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F11`, `PE_OrderList_ClonePattern`, `PE_OrderList_ExtendPattern`, `PE_OrderList_ToggleMuteWipe`, `PE_OrderList_ApplyMuteWipe`, `PE_OrderList_RenderDispatch`, `PE_OrderList_RenderQuicksave`, `PE_OrderList_GDispatch`, `PE_OrderList_RightDispatch`, `PE_OrderList_LeftDispatch`, `Music_FindFreePattern`, `Music_GetMuteChannelTable`, `ClonePatternMuteWipe`

<a id="f12-song-variables"></a>
## User Presses F12 (Song Variables & Directory Configuration)

`features/f12-song-variables.feature`

**What it does:** As someone setting up a tune and its working folders, I want F12 to open song variables plus the module/sample/instrument/quicksave directories, with each directory row pickable, and Samples->Instruments to keep my drawn envelopes, So that song config and folder routing live on one screen and nothing is lost.

**Behaviour (4 scenarios):**

- F12 opens the song variables & configuration screen — `@stock @build-verified`
- A Quicksave directory row is on the F12 screen — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Each directory row is Enter-pickable through a file browser — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Samples->Instruments keeps drawn envelopes — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F12`, `QuickSaveDirectoryInput`, `D_PickModuleDir`, `D_PickSampleDir`, `D_PickInstrumentDir`, `D_PickQuickSaveDir`, `D_PickDir_Common`, `F_SetControlInstrument`, `Music_InstrumentIsReal`

<a id="f2-pattern-editor"></a>
## User Presses F2 (Pattern Editor)

`features/f2-pattern-editor.feature`

**What it does:** As someone editing a tune, I want F2 to take me to the pattern editor, and a second F2 to open its configuration, with my chosen pattern length remembered for new patterns, So that the most-used screen is one key away and never forgets my row count.

**Behaviour (4 scenarios):**

- First F2 enters the pattern editor — `@stock @build-verified`
- Second F2 (already in the editor) opens Pattern Edit Config — `@stock @build-verified`
- F2-F2 remembers the chosen pattern length for new patterns — `@shipped @build-verified`
- A freshly-entered empty pattern uses the remembered length — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F2`, `NewPattern_ApplyDefaultLength`, `DefaultNewPatternLength`, `D_SaveDirectoryConfiguration`, `O1_PEConfigList`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×4 · @shipped ×2 · @stock ×2

<a id="f2-resize-tiles-pattern"></a>
## F2 pattern-length increase duplicates (tiles) the existing content

`features/f2-resize-tiles-pattern.feature` · [session](f2-resize-tiles-pattern.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone lengthening a pattern from the F2 config screen, I want the existing rows duplicated to fill the new length, So that growing 64 -> 128 (or 192) gives me repeats of my material to edit, not a block of empty rows I have to re-enter.

**Behaviour (6 scenarios):**

- 64 -> 128 duplicates the 64 rows once — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- 64 -> 192 duplicates the 64 rows twice — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Non-multiple lengths get a partial final copy ("until the end") — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Shrinking the pattern does not tile — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Scope is the F2 config path only — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The tiled buffer persists via the working-copy model — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `PE_TilePatternToLength`, `Glbl_F2`, `PE_OrderList_ExtendPattern`, `NumberOfRows`, `MaxRow` · **Source files:** `IT_G.ASM`, `IT_PE.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×6 · @runtime-verified ×3 · @shipped ×6

**Commits:** `05c70c9` F2 pattern-length increase tiles content instead of blank rows


<a id="f3-sample-list"></a>
## User Presses F3 (Sample List)

`features/f3-sample-list.feature`

**What it does:** As someone working with raw samples, I want F3 to open the sample list and Ctrl-F3 to reach the disk library, And I want previewing a sample in the loader to NOT kill the playing song, So that sample work never silences the tune I'm building it for.

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- F3 opens the sample list — `@stock @build-verified`
- Ctrl-F3 opens the disk Sample Library from anywhere — `@stock @build-verified`
- Previewing a sample in the loader does not stop the song — `@shipped @build-verified`
- MIDI transport bytes can't restart the song mid-load — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Shift-Enter bulk sample load is guarded the same way — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F3`, `Glbl_Ctrl_F3`, `MIDISyncLoaderSuppress`, `MIDI_SetLoaderSuppress`, `MIDI_ClearLoaderSuppress`, `Music_SilenceSampleVoices`, `D_PreLoadSampleWindow`, `LSWindow_ShiftEnter` · **Source files:** `IT_I.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×5 · @shipped ×3 · @stock ×2

**Commits:** `fb47b32` Import code (upstream base: F3 sample list, Ctrl-F3 library) · `a44c41b` Music_SilenceSampleVoices: keep playback alive across (re)loads · `64fa1ce` F3 loader keyjazz hang fix: suppress MIDI sync during LoadSample · `ec91331` F3 loader keyjazz: instrument LoadSample + PlaySample w/ VRAM markers


<a id="f4-instrument-list"></a>
## User Presses F4 (Instrument List)

`features/f4-instrument-list.feature`

**What it does:** As someone shaping instruments (envelopes, NNA, MIDI), I want F4 to open the instrument editor and repeated F4 to cycle its tabs, And Ctrl-F4 to reach the disk instrument library, So that all four envelope/MIDI tabs of an instrument are reachable from one key.

**Behaviour (4 scenarios):**

- F4 opens the instrument editor — `@stock @build-verified`
- Pressing F4 again cycles the instrument tabs — `@stock @build-verified`
- Ctrl-F4 opens the disk Instrument Library from anywhere — `@stock @build-verified`
- The per-instrument MIDI-In Channel is edited on the Pitch tab — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F4`, `Glbl_Ctrl_F4`, `I_SelectScreen`, `InstrumentScreenTable`, `InstrumentMIDIInChannel`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×4 · @shipped ×1 · @stock ×3

**Commits:** `fb47b32` Import code (upstream base: F4 instrument list + tab cycle) · `10c837b` per-instrument MIDI-In channel field (hdr 1Fh) on the Pitch tab


<a id="f6-play-from-order-list-row"></a>
## Order List F6 loops the selected order's pattern; F7 plays from it at the cursor row

`features/f6-play-from-order-list-row.feature` · [session](f6-play-from-order-list-row.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone arranging a song in the F11 Order List, I want F6 to loop the pattern at the order row I selected, and F7 to start playback from that order at the row my edit cursor is on, So that I can audition any order's pattern in place, and resume the song from any order at the exact row I was working on.

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- F6 loops the pattern at the selected order row — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- F6 outside the Order List keeps its stock "play current pattern" — `@shipped @build-verified`
- A skip/end marker order slot is a no-op — `@shipped @build-verified`
- F7 plays from the SELECTED order at the current edit row — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- F7 outside the Order List keeps its stock from-mark behaviour — `@stock @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F6`, `PE_OrderListLoopPattern`, `PE_F7`, `Music_PlayPattern`, `Music_PlayPartSong`, `Music_GetPattern` · **Source files:** `IT_G.ASM`, `IT_PE.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×5 · @runtime-untested ×2 · @shipped ×4 · @stock ×1

**Commits:** `8acb41f` first cut: F6 = Music_PlaySong(Order) (superseded -- wrong: that · `5b37353` F6 loops the selected order's pattern; F7 plays from order+current row


<a id="midi-in-multitimbral"></a>
## Multitimbral MIDI-In

`features/midi-in-multitimbral.feature` · [session](midi-in-multitimbral.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician driving the DOS PC from an external MIDI source, I want incoming notes on MIDI channels 01-16 to each trigger their own Impulse Tracker instrument live, So that Impulse Tracker becomes a 16-part sampler-synth, even while the transport is stopped.

**Behaviour (9 scenarios):**

- Output MIDI fields are independent of the input field — `@stock @shipped @build-verified`
- Each instrument can claim an incoming MIDI channel — `@shipped @build-verified`
- First Shift-F4 maps current samples to MIDI-In 01-16 — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Second Shift-F4 replicates 01-16 across six banks (96 instruments) — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Third Shift-F4 resets the six banks back to one 01-16 set — `@shipped @build-verified`
- An incoming note on channel N triggers the matching instrument — `@shipped`
- Channel 1 note entry is unchanged when the router is off — `@shipped`
- The router on/off switch lives on the Shift-F1 MIDI screen — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Polyphony per channel — `@todo`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Music_CreateMIDIInInstruments`, `Music_ExpandMIDIInTo96`, `Music_ResetMIDIInTo16`, `MCMI_BuildSlot`, `Music_GetMIDIMultiBanks`, `Music_GetMIDIMultiEnable`, `Music_SetMIDIMultiEnable`, `MIDIMultiEnable`, `MIDIMultiBanks`, `Glbl_Shift_F4`, `Glbl_MIDIMulti_Toggle`, `MIDIMulti_Route`, `MMR_FindInst`, `MIDIMultiToggleButton`, `O1_ConfirmCreateMIDIIn`, `InstrumentMIDIInChannel` · **Source files:** `IT_MUSIC.ASM`, `IT_OBJ1.ASM`, `IT_G.ASM`, `IT_K.ASM`, `IT_I.ASM`

<a id="midi-out-stop-on-f8"></a>
## Send MIDI Stop (FC) out on F8

`features/midi-out-stop-on-f8.feature` · [session](midi-out-stop-on-f8.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician whose DOS PC is the master in a MIDI rig, I want pressing F8 (Stop) to also transmit a single MIDI Stop to slaved gear, So that one keypress halts both Impulse Tracker and everything downstream, with no risk of a transport feedback loop.

**Behaviour (6 scenarios):**

- F8 transmits exactly one MIDI Stop byte out — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The Stop byte does not disturb MIDI running status — `@shipped @build-verified`
- With no MIDI-capable driver the transmit is a clean no-op — `@shipped @build-verified`
- A MIDI-thru loopback cannot create a transport storm — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The toggle defaults ON and is flipped on the Shift-F1 MIDI screen — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- With the toggle OFF, F8 behaves exactly like stock — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_F8`, `Music_SendMIDIStop`, `Glbl_MIDIStopF8_Toggle`, `MIDI_F8StopEnabled` · **Source files:** `IT_G.ASM`, `IT_MUSIC.ASM`, `IT_K.ASM`, `IT_OBJ1.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×6 · @runtime-untested ×1 · @shipped ×6

**Commits:** `67cdb60` 2026-06-04 Glbl_F8 transmits 0FCh out, gated by Shift-F1 toggle


<a id="midi-realtime-sync"></a>
## External MIDI Real-Time Sync

`features/midi-realtime-sync.feature` · [session](midi-realtime-sync.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician slaving the DOS PC to an external sequencer or drum machine, I want MIDI System Real-Time messages to drive Impulse Tracker's transport and tempo, So that pressing play on the master device starts, stops, and clocks IT in time with the rest of the rig.

**Behaviour (11 scenarios):**

- Real-Time bytes are dispatched without disturbing running status — `@shipped @build-verified`
- 0xFA Start plays the song from the top — `@shipped @build-verified`
- 0xFC Stop halts playback — `@shipped @build-verified`
- 0xFB Continue currently behaves as Start (known v1 limitation) — `@shipped @build-verified`
- 0xFB Continue resumes from the last-known order/row — `@todo`
- 0xF8 Clock derives IT tempo from the master at 24 PPQ — `@shipped @build-verified`
- MIDI Transport can be switched off, swallowing FA/FB/FC — `@shipped @build-verified`
- MIDI Sync (clock) can be switched off independently, ignoring F8 — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Loader keyjazz suppresses transport re-entry — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Sound drivers pass F8-FF through to MIDISend — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The MIDI Monitor shows live Real-Time byte counters — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Source files:** `IT_K.ASM`, `SoundDrivers/*.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×10 · @shipped ×10 · @todo ×1

**Commits:** `ec42bd1` 2026-04-23 FA/FB/FC start/continue/stop dispatch in MIDISend · `03b0a6d` 2026-05-01 F8 Clock 0xF8 external tempo sync (24 PPQ) · `0a82cb3` 2026-05-01 F8 Clock enable flag (default off) + delta sanity check · `ad5d840` 2026-05-04 MIDI Sync default ON + Alt-F12 toggle <- SUPERSEDED by 7163709 · `7163709` 2026-05-04 toggle moved from Alt-F12 to Shift-F1 MIDI screen button · `95f628a` 2026-05-04 MIDI Monitor: FA/FB/FC/F8 byte counters on Shift-F1 · `4ebf849` 2026-05-04 14 drivers (SB16/ES/AWE32/GOLD16) stop filtering F8-FF · `78fb72d` 2026-05-04 GUSMIXDR + IWDRV stop filtering F8-FF (the last 2) · `731e168` 2026-05-18 independent MIDI Transport (FA/FB/FC) gate


<a id="multi-wav"></a>
## Multi-WAV render

`features/multi-wav.feature` · [session](multi-wav.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone bouncing a tune to stems or a mix, I want to render the current pattern per channel, or the whole song as one WAV or as per-channel stems, So that I can take Impulse Tracker output into another DAW — NOTE: this whole feature is shipped but NOT yet runtime-tested (see header).

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- Shift-Alt-M renders the current pattern per non-empty channel — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- F10 "WAV" renders the whole song to a single WAV — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- F10 "MWAV" renders the whole song as per-channel stems — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- The Shift+Alt keymap path exists (this part IS structural) — `@shipped @build-verified`
- WHAT WOULD VERIFY THIS CARD (the test that has not been run) — `@runtime-untested`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `PEFunction_StartMultiWAVKey`, `Music_StartMultiWAV`, `Music_StartFullSongWAV`, `Music_StartFullSongMWAV`, `K_TranslateCondition11`, `PE_ChannelIsEmpty` · **Source files:** `IT_PE.ASM`, `IT_MUSIC.ASM`, `IT_K.ASM`

## F4 instrument-list play dots in multitimbral Sample mode

`features/multitimbral-instrument-play-dots.feature` · [session](multitimbral-instrument-play-dots.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone playing a multitimbral MIDI rig into IT with the song in Sample mode, I want the F4 Instrument List to show live play dots while notes sound, just like the F3 Sample List already does, So that I can see which routed instruments are active without switching to the sample screen.

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- Stock IT hid the F4 dots whenever instrument mode was off — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- With the router on, F4 shows play dots even in Sample mode — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Normal Sample mode (router off) is unchanged — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Instrument mode still shows dots exactly as before — `@stock @build-verified`
- The dot row is the routed instrument, not a sentinel — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `I_ShowInstrumentPlay`, `I_ShowSamplePlay`, `Music_GetInstrumentMode`, `Music_GetMIDIMultiEnable`, `MIDIMulti_Route` · **Source files:** `IT_I.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×5 · @runtime-untested ×2 · @shipped ×4 · @stock ×1

`features/no-samples-to-instruments-envelope-retention.feature` · [session](no-samples-to-instruments-envelope-retention.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone who needs a NON-CRASHING tracker above all, I want F12 "Initialise Instruments? = YES" to do exactly what upstream IT2.15 does -- clear all instruments and rebuild a clean sample-name + 120-note keymap -- with NO attempt to preserve drawn envelopes across the flip, So that nothing in the load/convert path can ever feed garbage instrument slots to the envelope renderer and hard-crash IT (EMM386 #12).

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- Initialise Instruments = YES does the upstream clear + remap — `@stock @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- The envelope-retention feature and its IMPI checker are gone — `@build-verified`
- Shift-Enter bulk-load can no longer feed the crash class — `@build-verified`
- The I_MapEnvelope MaxNode<=25 clamp stays as defensive insurance — `@stock @build-verified`
- (guardrail) Do not re-introduce envelope retention without HW verify — `@todo`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `F_SetControlInstrument`, `Music_InstrumentIsReal`, `Music_ClearAllInstruments` · **Source files:** `IT_F.ASM`, `IT_DISK.ASM`, `IT_I.ASM`

## '1' toggles the note cut under the cursor

`features/note-cut-toggle.feature` · [session](note-cut-toggle.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone editing a pattern, I want pressing '1' on a cell that already shows ^^^ to clear it, So that the same key both places and removes a note cut without reaching for '.'.

**Behaviour (3 scenarios):**

- First '1' on an empty (or noted) cell stamps a note cut — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Second '1' on a note-cut cell wipes it — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Note-off and '.' are unchanged — `@stock @build-verified`

## Pattern length beyond 200 rows (256 / 512)

`features/pattern-length-beyond-200.feature` · [session](pattern-length-beyond-200.session.md)

**What it does:** As a user, I want 256- or 512-row patterns, So that I can write longer phrases in a single pattern.

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- The unpacked editor buffer is a single 64,000-byte segment = 200 rows exactly
- Row offsets are computed with 16-bit math that wraps past ~64KB
- Block and network ops pack the row index into a byte (cap 255)
- The on-disk .IT Rows field is a WORD, but the spec defines 32..200 — `@stock`
- What it would actually take (NOT done — recorded for honesty)

## Impulse Tracker fork — what got baked in 2026-06-03 → 04

`features/recent-features-2026-06-03_to_04.feature` · [session](recent-features-2026-06-03_to_04.session.md)

**What it does:** As the musician driving this fork, I want one page that lists every behaviour added/changed in the last two days, each graded honestly and linked to its own detailed card, So that I can see at a glance what is live, what is only build-verified, and what still needs a runtime check.

**Behaviour (11 scenarios):**

- Ctrl-F (and Scroll Lock) jump to the Pattern Editor with Follow ON — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Single-pattern Quicksave renders are LL<HHMMSS>.WAV — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- A second render gesture mid-render no longer wedges IT — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Multi-WAV per-channel + whole-song WAV/MWAV  (NOT runtime-tested) — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Shift-Enter on a module row bulk-loads all its samples (.MOD hang fixed) — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Shift-F4 cycles multitimbral build + enters Instrument mode — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- F4 instrument list shows live play dots in multitimbral Sample mode — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- F2 pattern-length increase tiles the existing rows — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Sample Amplify (Alt-M) no longer stops the song — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- F12 Samples->Instruments envelope retention was removed (back to upstream) — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Pre-existing features that received their triad card in this window — `@shipped @build-verified`

## Sample Amplify keeps the song playing

`features/sample-amplify-keeps-playback.feature` · [session](sample-amplify-keeps-playback.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician tweaking a sample's level while a tune is running, I want pressing Alt-M (Amplify / normalize) and confirming it to scale the sample WITHOUT stopping playback, So that I can hear the change in context and keep my flow, instead of the whole song cutting out every time I amplify a sample.

**Behaviour (9 scenarios):**

- Amplifying a sample mid-playback does not stop the song — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Alt-M Maximize/Normalize during playback keeps playing through OK/Process — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- REGRESSION (reported 2026-06-03) - Alt-M still stopped F6 playback — `@runtime-verified`
- Alt-M on the Sample List is the Amplify gesture — `@stock @build-verified`
- The dialog pre-fills the no-clip (normalize) amplification — `@stock @build-verified`
- Only the amplified sample's voices are silenced, not all channels — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The mixer never reads the sample while it is being rewritten — `@shipped @build-verified`
- AX (the sample number) survives the silence call — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Other Sample-List operations that still stop the song are untouched — `@stock @build-verified`

<a id="scrolllock-follow-from-lists"></a>
## User Presses Scroll Lock while in F3 (Sample List) or F4 (Instrument List)

`features/scrolllock-follow-from-lists.feature` · [session](scrolllock-follow-from-lists.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone auditioning samples/instruments against a playing song, I want Scroll Lock on the list screens to drop me into the Pattern Editor with Pattern Follow Mode already on, So that one key takes me from "browsing a slot" to "watching the cursor follow playback" without a separate F2 then Scroll Lock.

**Behaviour (9 scenarios):**

- Scroll Lock inside the Pattern Editor still just toggles Follow Mode — `@stock @build-verified`
- Scroll Lock in the Sample List opens the Pattern Editor with Follow Mode on — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Scroll Lock in the Instrument List does the same — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Ctrl-F in the Sample List (F3) or Instrument List (F4) — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Ctrl-F INSIDE the Pattern Editor (F2) toggles Follow Mode, not the config dialog — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Ctrl-F on the Order List (F11) or Song Variables (F12) enters the editor — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Follow Mode is forced ON, never toggled off, from the lists — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The handler hands Glbl_F2 the dispatcher's own DS (no segment damage) — `@shipped @build-verified`
- (not built) Scroll Lock / Ctrl-F from other screens (Order list F11, Song vars F12) — `@todo`

## Shift-Enter Load from Sample List (bulk-load a module's samples)

`features/shift-enter-bulk-load-from-module.feature` · [session](shift-enter-bulk-load-from-module.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone who wants a module's instruments fast, I want Shift-Enter on a module file in the Load Sample browser to load every sample in that module into consecutive slots, one per row, keeping each sample's original name and loop mode, So that I can lift a whole module's sample set in a single keystroke.

**Behaviour (4 scenarios):**

- Shift-Enter on a module bulk-loads its samples into consecutive slots — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Loaded samples keep their original module names and loop modes — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- REGRESSION (reported 2026-06-03) - Shift-Enter on a .MOD hard-hangs IT
- REGRESSION (reported 2026-06-04) - after bulk-load the loader is parked

## Shift-Enter Load from Sample List

`features/shift-enter-load-from-sample-list.feature` · [session](shift-enter-load-from-sample-list.session.md)

**What it does:** As a user building a song from an existing module's samples, I want Shift-Enter on a module to pull in all its samples at once, So that I get every sample, named and loop-configured as in the source.

**Behaviour (4 scenarios):**

- Shift-Enter on a module loads its samples one per row — `@shipped`
- Loaded samples keep their original names and loop modes — `@shipped`
- In Instrument mode each sample is also auto-assigned to an instrument — `@shipped`
- Samples->Instruments envelope retention does NOT clash with this — `@shipped`

## Shift-F4 auto-builds a drumkit instrument alongside the 01-16 multitimbral set

`features/shift-f4-drumkit.feature` · [session](shift-f4-drumkit.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician setting up a multitimbral MIDI rig, I want Shift-F4 to also create one drumkit instrument that maps every sample to a key on MIDI channel 10, So that, in the same gesture that builds my 16 single-sample parts, I get a ready-to-play kit where each key fires a different sample.

**Behaviour (5 scenarios):**

- Shift-F4 Create builds the drumkit (01) + the 16 parts (02-17) — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- The drumkit maps each sample slot to a successive key — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- The drumkit responds to MIDI channel 10 — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Each pad plays its sample at fixed base pitch (C-5), not transposed — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- The 3-state Shift-F4 cycle never touches the drumkit — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `MCMI_BuildDrumkit`, `Music_CreateMIDIInInstruments`, `Music_ClearInstrument`, `Glbl_Shift_F4` · **Source files:** `IT_MUSIC.ASM`

**Grade:** @build-verified ×5 · @runtime-untested ×5 · @shipped ×5

## Shift-F4 to enable Multitimbral mode also switches Samples -> Instruments

`features/shift-f4-enters-instrument-mode.feature` · [session](shift-f4-enters-instrument-mode.session.md)

**What it does:** As someone enabling live multitimbral MIDI-in, I want confirming "Yes, enter Multitimbral Mode" to ALSO move me from Sample mode into Instrument mode (since the 16 things created are instruments), So that the instruments I just made are immediately the active, playable mode.

**Behaviour (4 scenarios):**

- From Sample mode, Shift-F4 + confirm enters Instrument mode with 16 instruments — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- The mode switch is a direct flag set, NOT the F12 clear/remap path — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Declining the prompt changes nothing — `@shipped @build-verified`
- (verify live) cursor + playback survive the mode switch — `@runtime-untested`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Glbl_Shift_F4`, `Music_CreateMIDIInInstruments`, `Glbl_F4` · **Source files:** `IT_G.ASM`

<a id="wav-render-quicksave"></a>
## WAV Quicksave render filename

`features/wav-render-quicksave.feature` · [session](wav-render-quicksave.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician rendering patterns to disk for use in another app, I want each single-pattern Quicksave render to come out as a real, time-stamped .WAV file (LL<HHMMSS>.WAV), So that the files sit time-sorted in the Quicksave folder and drag straight into another app, instead of clobbering each other or carrying a fake .000-style extension.

**Behaviour (8 scenarios):**

- Shift-Right at the order-list right edge renders to Quicksave only — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- Plain Right at the same edge renders AND auto-imports — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- A single-pattern Quicksave render is named by wall-clock time — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- The prefix is a static "LL" (Lackluster), not derived from the song — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The extension is a real .WAV, not the 3-digit pattern number — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- The auto-import opens the exact file WAVDRV wrote — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-untested`
- Multi-WAV, full-song, and user-named renders keep <PFX><NNNN> — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Two renders in the same second overwrite

## WAV render re-entry guard -- a second render gesture mid-render stops cleanly

`features/wav-render-reentry-guard.feature` · [session](wav-render-reentry-guard.session.md)

**What it does:** As a musician who fired a pattern-to-WAV render and then pressed a render key AGAIN before it finished (e.g. Right then Shift-Right at the F11 order-list right edge), I want that second press to halt the in-flight render cleanly -- like Esc -- and let the file finish writing to the Quicksave folder, So that IT.EXE does not glitch/wedge with no way out, and I do not lose the recording or have to kill the tracker.

**Behaviour (7 scenarios):**

- The old behaviour -- a second gesture tore the driver down mid-playback — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Right starts the render, Shift-Right during it halts and finalizes — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- WAV_FinalizeRequest tells the genuine finalize apart from a re-press — `@shipped @build-verified`
- The genuine auto-finalize is unchanged -- still leaves + imports — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Early-stop reuses the existing safe finalize, not a new teardown — `@shipped @build-verified @runtime-verified`
- All render entry points share the one central guard — `@shipped @build-verified`
- Multi-WAV sweep finalize and chaining are untouched — `@shipped @build-verified`

**How it does it:** **Key procs:** `Music_ToggleWAVRender`, `WAV_AlreadyActive`, `WAV_FinalizeRequest`, `WAV_LeaveMode`, `Music_Poll`, `Music_Stop`, `PE_OrderList_RightDispatch`, `PE_OrderList_RenderDispatch`, `PE_OrderList_RenderQuicksave`, `PE_OrderList_GDispatch` · **Source files:** `IT_PE.ASM`, `IT_MUSIC.ASM`
